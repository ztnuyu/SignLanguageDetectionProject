**Objectives:**
- To control the spread of contagious diseases - coronavirus.
- To act as an alternative to avoid drastic results in coronavirus disease.
- To reduce the physical contact between the infected and healthy people.

## B.  ABSTRACT 
Social distancing is a method used to control the spread of contagious diseases. It implies that people physically distance themselves from one another, reducing close contact, and thereby reducing the spread of a contagious disease (such as the COVID-19 Disease). In the battle against COVID-19, social distancing has proved to be a highly successful strategy for slowing the disease's spread. People are being urged to restrict their contacts with one another in order to reduce the risk of the virus spreading through physical or near contact. In the past, AI/Deep Learning has shown promise in solving a variety of everyday problems. We can see a clear overview of how we can use Python, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning to monitor social distancing in public places and workplaces in this proposed system. The social distancing detection tool will track whether people are maintaining a safe distance from each other in public places and the workplace to ensure social distancing protocol.

The Yolo algorithm stands for You Only Look Once, this algorithm is a state of art, which works on a real-time system, build on deep learning for solving various Object Detection as well as Object Tracking problems. The architecture of Yolo can be observed from the below Figure 2.

The architecture can be seen in the above diagram to contain the Input image layers, which are responsible for receiving the inputs that will be transmitted to subsequent levels. The input can be any picture depending on the use cases. Along the input layer is the DarkNet Architecture, which is an open-source neural network framework built with C and CUDA. This framework includes YOLO for object identification and tracking.


## C.  DATASET

We used 3 video as our dataset for training our social distancing detector. The detector will determine whether the distance between people is less than one metre or greater than one metre. This allows us to distinguish between those who strictly adhere to the protocol and those who disregard it.

When people visited Dinosaur Encounter @ Zoo Melaka in Melaka, Malaysia, a YouTube channel, Walk Around Malaysia uploaded this video. It was taken in December of 2020. Some people in this video keep the one-metre gap, but many do not.

</p>
This video was also taken from YouTube channel of Walk Around Malaysia, but it was shot in a different location. The photograph was taken in October 2020 at Kwai Chai Hong, Petaling Street Chinatown, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Many people were walking down the street, disregarding the 1-metre gap protocol.

</p>
This video was shot at a Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) restaurant in June 2021. We could see people queuing up for their turn while keeping a 1-metre gap between them as per protocol, but some people still do not.


## D.  PROJECT STRUCTURE

The following directory is our structure of our project:

- $ tree --dirsfirst --filelimit 10
- .
- ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyimagesearch
- ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
- |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ detection.py
- ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ social_distancing_config.py
- ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ yolo-coco
- ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coco.names
- ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ yolov3.cfg
- ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ yolov3.weights
- ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output.avi
- ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pedestrians.mp4
- ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ social_distance_detector.py
- 2 directories, 9 files

Our YOLO object detector files including the CNN architecture definition, pre-trained weights, and class names are housed in the yolo-coco/ directory. This YOLO model is compatible with OpenCV‚Äôs DNN module.

Three python scripts will be reviewed:

- social_distancing_config.py: A Python file holding a number of constants in one convenient place.
- detection.py: YOLO object detection with OpenCV involves more lines of code that some easier models. We‚Äôve decided to put the object detection logic in a function in this file for convenience. Doing so frees up our driver script‚Äôs frame processing loop from becoming especially cluttered
- social_distance_detector.py: This file is responsible for looping over frames of a video stream and ensuring that people are maintaining a healthy distance from one another during a pandemic. It is compatible with video files.

In the next two sections, we will train our social distancing detector.

## E. TRAINING THE SOCIAL DISTANCING DETECTOR

The model is trained by loading the dataset into the model first and then training it. The video stream is then identified once the model has been loaded. Finally, based on the distance frames, people are additionally labelled with markers indicating whether they maintain or violate social distancing.

A video will be loaded as the input of Social Distancing Detector. People are classified as maintaining social distancing or not depending on how much gap they maintain between them. They'll be labelled with different coloured frames, and the number of people who aren't socially isolated will be displayed. When two or more individuals stand near to one another, the system detects no social distancing, calculates the total number of persons who breach social distance, and labels them with a red frame, but when the frame is blue, the system finds there is social distance.

### Conclusion
Our project distinguishes the social distancing pattern and classifies them as a violation of social distancing or maintaining the social distancing norm. Additionally, it also displays labels number of people who violate the social distancing through a video. However, this system can be implemented in CCTV for surveillance of people during pandemics. To restrict the spread of the Covid-19, social separation and other fundamental hygienic measures are now critical.



## G.  PROJECT PRESENTATION 

In this project, we have learned how to implement a social distancing detector using OpenCV, computer vision, and deep learning.

Our implementation worked by:

- Using the YOLO object detector to detect people in a video stream ‚úîÔ∏è
 - Determining the centroids for each detected person ‚úîÔ∏è
 - Computing the pairwise distances between all centroids ‚úîÔ∏è
 - Checking to see if any pairwise distances were < N pixels apart, and if so, indicating that the pair of people violated social distancing rules ‚úîÔ∏è
<p>
  Furthermore, by using an NVIDIA CUDA-capable GPU, along with OpenCV‚Äôs dnn module compiled with NVIDIA GPU support, our method was able to run in real-time, making it usable as a proof-of-concept social distancing detector.
