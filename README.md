- to present a real time system of sign language detection.


##  B. ABSTRACT 

Deaf and mute people are usually deprived of normal communication with other people in the society. Also normal people find it difficult to understand and communicate with them. These people have to rely on an interpreter or on some sort of visual communication. An interpreter won’t be always available and visual communication is mostly difficult to understand. Sign Language is the primary means of communication in the deaf and dumb community. As a normal person is unaware of the grammar or meaning of various gestures that are part of a sign language, it is primarily limited to their families and/or deaf and dumb community.

The only way the speech and hearing impaired (i.e deaf) people can communicate is by sign language. The main problem of this way of communication is normal people who cannot understand sign language can’t communicate with these people or vice versa. Our project aims to bridge the gap between the speech and hearing impaired people and the normal people. The basic idea of this project is to make a system using which deaf people can significantly communicate with all other people using their normal gestures. The system does not require the background to be perfectly black. It works on any background. The project uses image processing system to identify, especially basic sign language gesture used by the deaf people to communicate and converts them into text so that normal people can understand.
