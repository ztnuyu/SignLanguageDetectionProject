## B.  ABSTRACT 
Social distancing is a method used to control the spread of contagious diseases. It implies that people physically distance themselves from one another, reducing close contact, and thereby reducing the spread of a contagious disease (such as the COVID-19 Disease). In the battle against COVID-19, social distancing has proved to be a highly successful strategy for slowing the disease's spread. People are being urged to restrict their contacts with one another in order to reduce the risk of the virus spreading through physical or near contact. In the past, AI/Deep Learning has shown promise in solving a variety of everyday problems. We can see a clear overview of how we can use Python, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning to monitor social distancing in public places and workplaces in this proposed system. The social distancing detection tool will track whether people are maintaining a safe distance from each other in public places and the workplace to ensure social distancing protocol.
